# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description 

This is an e-commerce application that I'm creating. Basically, the task is to build the backend for e-commerce website. We configure express.js api, to use sequelize to interact with mysql database. Because the app will not be deployed, a link to a walk-through video that demonstrates the functionnality and all accepting criteria. So, we have category mode, product model, tag model, and product tag model. So, the goal of this project is to is that, I want to be able to create, update, get, and delete data from in my database.

We use postman to request data. Therefore when I invoque the application, my server starts and sequelize mode are synced to my mysql database. When I open api route, for category, product, and tags, data for each of those routes are displayed and formatted in json. Thus, when I was able to request data from all the routes. Also update, delete or retrieve data.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to solve a problem in society. I wanted to be able to create an application for running a business. So, me as developper will be able to create data, update, delete, protect them with .env file and so on.

## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.
Mysql was also used to create data in database. Postman was used to request data since we are just using a e-commerce-Back-end .  

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The biggest obstacle was how to get the routes work.
